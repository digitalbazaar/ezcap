## Background

This library provides a client that browser and node.js applications can use to
interact with HTTP servers protected by ZCAP-based authorization. The library
is configured with secure and sensible defaults to help developers get started
quickly and ensure that their client code is production-ready.

## Security

TBD

## Install

- Node.js 12+ is required.

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalbazaar/ezcap.git
cd ezcap
npm install
```

* [Delegating a Capability](#delegating-a-capability)

### Creating a Client

```js
import {ZcapClient, getCapabilitySigners} from 'ezcap';
import didKey from 'did-method-key';
const didKeyDriver = didKey.driver();

// the base URL for the ZCAP client to operate against
const baseUrl = 'https://zcap.example';

// generate a DID Document and set of keypairs
const {didDocument, keyPairs} = await didKeyDriver.generate();

// extract the capability invocation and delegation signers
const {invocationSigner, delegationSigner} = getCapabilitySigners({
  didDocument, keyPairs});

// create a new ZCAP client using the generated cryptographic material
const zcapClient = new ZcapClient({baseUrl, invocationSigner, delegationSigner});
```

### Reading

```js
const url = '/items';

// reading a URL using a zcap will result in an HTTP Response
const response = await zcapClient.read({url});

// retrieve the JSON data
const items = await response.json();
```

### Writing

```js
const url = '/items';
const item = {label: 'Widget'};

// writing a URL using a zcap will result in an HTTP Response
const response = await zcapClient.write({url, json: item});

// process the response appropriately
const writtenItem = await response.json();
```

### Invoking a Capability

```js
const url = '/items';
const item = {count: 12};

// invoking a capability against a URL will result in an HTTP Response
const response = await zcapClient.invoke({url, method: 'patch', json: item});

// process the response appropriately
const updatedItem = await response.json();
```

### Delegating a Capability

```js
const capability = 'https://zcap.example/foo';
const delegate = 'did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH';
const actions = ['read'];
const delegatedCapability = zcapClient.delegate({
  capability, delegate, actions
});
```
